  abstract = {While Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have achieved performance levels comparable to human experts on various predictive tasks, human experts can still access valuable contextual information not yet incorporated into AI predictions. Humans assisted by AI predictions could outperform both human-alone or AI-alone. We conduct an experiment with professional radiologists that varies the availability of AI assistance and contextual information to study the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration and to investigate how to optimize it. Our findings reveal that (i) providing AI predictions does not uniformly increase diagnostic quality, and (ii) providing contextual information does increase quality. Radiologists do not fully capitalize on the potential gains from AI assistance because of large deviations from the benchmark Bayesian model with correct belief updating. The observed errors in belief updating can be explained by radiologists' partially underweighting the AI's information relative to their own and not accounting for the correlation between their own information and AI predictions. In light of these biases, we design a collaborative system between radiologists and AI. Our results demonstrate that, unless the documented mistakes can be corrected, the optimal solution involves assigning cases either to humans or to AI, but rarely to a human assisted by AI.},

  abstract = {As children reach adolescence, peer interactions become increasingly central to their development, whereas the direct influence of parents wanes. Nevertheless, parents may continue to exert leverage by shaping their children's peer groups. We study interactions of parenting style and peer effects in a model where children's skill accumulation depends on both parental inputs and peers, and where parents can affect the peer group by restricting who their children can interact with. We estimate the model and show that it can capture empirical patterns regarding the interaction of peer characteristics, parental behavior, and skill accumulation among US high school students. We use the estimated model for policy simulations. We find that interventions (e.g., busing) that move children to a more favorable neighborhood have large effects but lose impact when they are scaled up because parents' equilibrium responses push against successful integration with the new peer group.},

Studies have shown that parenting style, is one the most important and fundamental factors in personality development. The purpose of this study was comparison of parenting style in single child and multiple children families. Materials and Methods: This study, in total, 152 mothers from Andimeshk city, Iran, were selected by random sampling. Data were collected from a health-care center was chosen randomly, mothers who had 5-7 years old children were enrolled in this study. The data collecting tool was the questionnaire which investigates permissive, authoritative, and authoritarian parenting styles in parents. After data entry in SPSS software, the collected data were analyzed by ANOVA, independent t-test, and Pearson correlation test. Results: The mean age of the participants was 32.71 {\textpm} 5.39 years old participated in this study. 69 mothers (45.4\%) had one child, 53 (34.9\%) had 2 children, and 30 mothers (19.7\%) had 3 and more children. The mean score of permissive parenting style was 19.97 {\textpm} 5.13 in single child families; the mean score of authoritative (19.56 {\textpm} 4.70) and authoritarian parenting style (34.50 {\textpm} 2.81) that difference was significantly (P {$<$} 0.050). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it seems that having more children would make parents more logical and paves the way for upbringing children. Therefore, it is recommended to plan some educational programs about this issue for parents.},

  abstract = {Rising female labor force participation and recent changes to the welfare system have increased the importance of child care for all women and, particularly, the less-skilled. This paper focuses on the child care decisions of women who differ by their skill level and the role that costs play in their work decision. After reviewing government child-care programs targeted at less-skilled women, we present a descriptive analysis of current utilization and child care costs. We emphasize differences across skill groups, showing that the least-skilled women both use less costly paid care and are more likely to use unpaid care. We then survey the existing evidence regarding the responsiveness of female labor supply to child care costs, reviewing both econometric studies and demonstration projects that include child care components. To investigate variation in the response to child care cost across skill levels, we implement models similar to this past literature. We conclude that while the overall elasticity of labor force participation with respect to the market price of child care is between -0.05 and -0.35, this elasticity is larger for the least skilled women and declines with skill. Throughout the paper, we reflect upon the implications of our analysis for welfare reform.},

During this period, the maximum duration of paid leave and that of job-protection remained unchanged, and therefore, I can isolate the effects of changes in the amount of cash benefit from those due to changes in duration of leave. By comparing the job continuity of women who gave birth to their child before the reform and those who did so after the reform, I find little evidence that the labour supply pattern of new mothers changed in response to the increased cash benefit.},

  doi = {10.2514/6.2004-6313},
  abstract = {Various levels of automation can be introduced by intelligent decision support systems, from fully automated, where the operator is completely left out of the decision process, to minimal levels of automation, where the automation only makes recommendations and the operator has the final say. For rigid tasks that require no flexibility in decision-making and with a low probability of system failure, higher levels of automation often provide the best solution. However, in time critical environments with many external and changing constraints such as air traffic control and military command and control operations, higher levels of automation are not advisable because of the risks and the complexity of both the system and the inability of the automated decision aid to be perfectly reliable. Human-in-the-loop designs, which employ automation for redundant, manual, and monotonous tasks and allow operators active participation, provide not only safety benefits, but also allow a human operator and a system to respond more flexibly to uncertain and unexpected events. However, there can be measurable costs to human performance when automation is used, such as loss of situational awareness, complacency, skill degradation, and automation bias. This paper will discuss the influence of automation bias in intelligent decision support systems, particularly those in aviation domains. Automation bias occurs in decision-making because humans have a tendency to disregard or not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution that is accepted as correct and can be exacerbated in time critical domains. Automated decision aids are designed to reduce human error but actually can cause new errors in the operation of a system if not designed with human cognitive limitations in mind.},

This is particularly prevalent in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting the need to understand how IPV can be reduced. Our aim was to summarize the evidence base for interventions to reduce IPV in LMICs. We searched for studies published in peer-reviewed journals in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science from January 1st 2012 to November 29th 2021, and included studies that evaluated interventions directed at IPV in LMICs, targeted at individuals in intimate relationships. Effect sizes were analyzed in a three-level meta-analysis. Fortyeight interventions were identified and the approaches employed fall within five of the seven domains of the WHO RESPECT Framework. The overall effects of interventions on participants'; attitudes toward IPV and on IPV behavior were small and non-significant (attitudes: d = - 0.302, 95\% CI - 0.635--0.032; behavior: d = - 0.077, 95\% CI - 0.165--0.009). Heterogeneity in effects was substantial, suggesting that some interventions were more effective than others. The number of interventions available show that progress is being made to generate evi\- dence in LMICs, but a lot more needs to be done in developing and implementing effective interventions to reduce IPV.},

The main finding is that children of parents with low education are more spiteful, more selfish and less altruistic. This link is robust to controlling for a rich set of child characteristics and class fixed effects. The parental effects stand out against the overall development of preferences, as we find children to become less spiteful and more altruistic with increasing age. Our findings, complemented by an analysis of the World Values Survey data, suggest that low socio-economic status affects parental effort invested in instilling other-regarding preferences into children, making them less likely to acquire cooperative types of preferences.},

  doi = {10.48550/arxiv.2306.16507},
  abstract = {Uses of artificial intelligence (AI), especially those powered by machine learning approaches, are growing in sectors and societies around the world. How will AI adoption proceed, especially in the international security realm? Research on automation bias suggests that humans can often be overconfident in AI, whereas research on algorithm aversion shows that, as the stakes of a decision rise, humans become more cautious about trusting algorithms. We theorize about the relationship between background knowledge about AI, trust in AI, and how these interact with other factors to influence the probability of automation bias in the international security context. We test these in a preregistered task identification experiment across a representative sample of 9000 adults in 9 countries with varying levels of AI industries. The results strongly support the theory, especially concerning AI background knowledge. A version of the Dunning Kruger effect appears to be at play, whereby those with the lowest level of experience with AI are slightly more likely to be algorithm-averse, then automation bias occurs at lower levels of knowledge before leveling off as a respondent's AI background reaches the highest levels. Additional results show effects from the task's difficulty, overall AI trust, and whether a human or AI decision aid is described as highly competent or less competent.},

  author = {Benjamin, Daniel J},
  abstract = {Errors in probabilistic reasoning have been the focus of much psychology research and are among the original topics of modern behavioral economics. This chapter reviews theory and evidence on this topic, with the goal of facilitating more systematic study of belief biases and their integration into economics. The chapter discusses biases in beliefs about random processes, biases in belief updating, the representativeness heuristic as a possible unifying theory, and interactions between biased belief updating and other features of the updating situation. Throughout, I aim to convey how much evidence there is for (and against) each putative bias, and I highlight when and how different biases may be related to each other. The chapter ends by drawing general lessons for when people update too much or too little, reflecting on modeling challenges, pointing to areas of economics to which the biases are relevant, and highlighting some possible directions for future work.},

The description of bias in decision making arising from machine learning outlined in this article sets to demonstrate the scale of the issue and the value of transparency in decision making that affects the daily life of ordinary humans. Fully automated solutions without appropriate governance can be problematic due to the replication of human biases which can be captured and imposed upon the training process of a machine learning models. Decision makers must be aware of limitations within the data and proceed with caution. As such, transparency in how data is used to make decisions is vital. Despite the ever-increasing reliance on algorithms in decision making, human oversight is critical. This article serves to raise awareness of this aspect of machine learning.},

  abstract = {If couples decide to have fewer children in order to achieve higher "quality" offspring, are they correct in assuming that the quality of children bears an important and inverse relation to family size? If they are correct, how does number of children operate to affect individual quality? This research (using U.S. whites primarily) takes educational attainment (among adults) and college plans (among youngsters) as the principal indicators of quality, but also directs some attention to measures of intelligence. The analysis supports the "dilution model" (on average, the more children the lower the quality of each child) and indicates that only children do not suffer from lack of siblings, and that other last-borns are not handicapped by a "teaching deficit." Number of siblings (relative to other background variables) is found to have an important detrimental impact on child quality-an impact compounded by the fact that, when couples are at a stage in life to make family-size decisions, most background factors (however important to the quality of their children) are no longer readily manipulable. A special path analysis of college plans among boys uses a modification {$\cdot$}of Sewell's Wisconsin Model as its base. The results show that number of siblings is a negative influence on intervening variables affecting college plans. In general, the research documents the unfavorable consequences for individual siblings of high fertility, even in a country that is (at least for whites) as socially, economically, and politically advantaged as the United States.},

The "local Gaussian" property of the generic continuous-time benchmark model enables optimal "finite-sample" inference in a well-defined sense. It also affords more reliable inference in empirically realistic settings compared to conventional large-sample approaches. Two applications pertaining to the tracking performance of leveraged ETFs and an intraday event study illustrate the practical usefulness of the new procedures.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by many organizations has recently raised concerns that AI may eventually replace humans in certain tasks. In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM's cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking.

  abstract = {Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is a global policy issue with significant social, economic and personal consequences. The burden of violence against women and girls is distributed unequally, with rates of gender violence significantly higher in low to middle income countries of the Global South. Yet the bulk of global research on gender violence is based on the experiences of urban communities in high-income English-speaking countries mainly from the Global North. This body of research typically takes the experience of women from Anglophone countries as the norm from which to theorise and frame theories and research of gender-based violence. Our chapter problematises theories that the privilege women in the Global North as the empirical referents of `everyday violence' (Carrington, Hogg and Sozzo, 2016). At the same time however it is important to resist homogenisng the violence experienced by women across diverse societies in the global south. This orientalist vision of oppressed subaltern Southern women is directly contrasted with an ideal rights bearing feminine subject from the Anglophone countries of the global north (Mohanty, 2012). This binary discourse exaggerates the differences and obfuscates the similarities of VAWG across Northern and Southern borders and reproduces images of women in the Global South as unfortunate victims of `other' cultures (Durham, 2015; Narayan, 1997). This chapter contrasts three examples, the policing of family violence in Indigenous communities in Australia; Image Based Abuse in Singapore; and the policing of gender violence in the Pacific as a way of concretising the argument.},

We explore a sample of preschoolers and their mothers drawn from the EU-SILC (2005--2013) in a set of 11 EU countries with different institutional settings. The analytical strategy -- a set of simultaneous tobit models -- allows for mutual interdependencies across decisions. The results vary across welfare regimes and are related to the public provision of child care as well as other dimensions of the institutional context and values. We have found complementarities between paid employment and child care while formal and informal care are shown to be mutual substitutes, even in countries where the provision of external, formal child care is very extended and child care does not depend much on families. This means that the mere expansion of public child care is not enough to improve maternal employment rates. Other institutional aspects of the labour market and societal values also need to be taken into account in this endeavour.},

  abstract = {Background: This systematic review and meta-regression sought to identify the relative importance of factors associated with physical, emotional, and sexual violence against children in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding of factors associated with violence is important for targeted programming and prevention on the population level. Methods: We searched 17 electronic databases from 1989 to 2018 and reports from child violence surveys. Nationally representative studies that described evidence on potential factors associated with violence against children under 18 years old were included. The search was restricted to the English language. Factors were synthesized quantitatively using robust variance estimation, with 95\% confidence intervals, for each violence type. Results: We identified 8,346 unduplicated studies, and 103 publications met our eligibility criteria. The data distribution was uneven across region, country income status, factors, and violence types. Of the 94 eligible studies quantitatively synthesized, no specific factors were significant for physical violence. Lower household socioeconomic status, being a girl, and primary education of mothers and adults in the household were associated with emotional violence, and being a girl was associated with sexual violence. Conclusion: A broad spectrum of factors merit consideration for physical violence policy and prevention among the general population of children in low- and middle-income countries. Conversely, a tailored approach may be warranted for preventing emotional and sexual violence. Information is unequally distributed across countries, factors, and violence types. Greater emphasis should be placed on collecting representative data on the general population and vulnerable subgroups to achieve national reductions in violence against children.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) as decision support for personnel preselection, e.g., in the form of a dashboard, promises a more effective and fairer selection process. However, AI-based decision support systems might prompt decision makers to thoughtlessly accept the system's recommendation. As this so-called automation bias contradicts ethical and legal requirements of human oversight for the use of AI-based recommendations in personnel preselection, the present study investigates strategies to reduce automation bias and increase decision quality. Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we assume that instructing decision makers about the possibility of system errors and their responsibility for the decision, as well as providing an appropriate level of data aggregation should encourage decision makers to process information systematically instead of heuristically. We conducted a 3 (general information, information about system errors, information about responsibility) x 2 (low vs. high aggregated data) experiment to investigate which strategy can reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality. We found that less automation bias in terms of higher scores on verification intensity indicators correlated with higher objective decision quality, i.e., more suitable applicants selected. Decision makers who received information about system errors scored higher on verification intensity indicators and rated subjective decision quality higher, but decision makers who were informed about their responsibility, unexpectedly, did not. Regarding aggregation level of data, decision makers of the highly aggregated data group spent less time on the level of the dashboard where highly aggregated data were presented. Our results show that it is important to inform decision makers who interact with AI-based decision-support systems about potential system errors and provide them with less aggregated data to reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality.},

Addressing endogeneity issues with an instrumental variable/ regression discontinuity design estimator based on children's birth months, we find sizable and positive effects of childcare on women's own labor market outcomes and their household income and poverty status. The effects of childcare differ by women's characteristics and are stronger for women in the ethnic majority group or women with daughters. These effects are also somewhat larger for areas with higher income levels. Furthermore, we also find that some positive effects last after two years.},

Throughout, I aim to convey how much evidence there is for (and against) each putative bias, and I highlight when and how different biases may be related to each other. The chapter ends by drawing general lessons for when people update too much or too little, reflecting on modeling challenges, pointing to areas of economics to which the biases are relevant, and highlighting some possible directions for future work.

This study tests for the presence of AB in e-prescribing and the impact of task complexity and interruptions on AB. One hundred and twenty students in the final two years of a medical degree prescribed medicines for nine clinical scenarios using a simulated e-prescribing system. Quality of CDS (correct, incorrect and no CDS) and task complexity (low, low\,+\,interruption and high) were varied between conditions. Omission errors (failure to detect prescribing errors) and commission errors (acceptance of false positive alerts) were measured. Compared to scenarios with no CDS, correct CDS reduced omission errors by 38.3},

Starting with the work of pioneers such as Gary Becker, economists have used the tool set of their discipline to understand what parents do and how parents' actions affect their children. In recent years, the literature on parenting within economics has increasingly leveraged findings and concepts from related disciplines that also deal with parent--child interactions. For example, economists have developed models to understand the choice among various parenting styles that were first explored in the developmental psychology literature and have estimated detailed empirical models of children's accumulation of cognitive and noncognitive skills in response to parental and other inputs. In this review, we survey the economic literature on parenting and point out promising directions for future research.},

Parents maximize an objective function that combines Beckerian altruism and paternalism towards children. They can affect their children's choices via two channels: either by influencing children's preferences or by imposing direct restrictions on their choice sets. Different parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected both by parental preferences and by the socioeconomic environment. Parenting style, in turn, feeds back into the children's welfare and economic success. The theory is consistent with the decline of authoritarian parenting observed in industrialized countries and with the greater prevalence of more permissive parenting in countries characterized by low inequality.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the prevalence and exacerbating factors of violence against women and children in Germany during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods We conducted a representative online survey with partnered women (18--65 years) between 22 April and 8 May 2020, when participants had been under lockdown for a month. We determined the prevalence of several forms of violence within the previous month using both direct elicitation and a list experiment. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to assess the impact of pandemicassociated risk factors. Findings Of our 3818 survey respondents, 118 (3.09\%; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 2.54 to 3.64) reported incidents of physical conflict, 293 (7.67\%; 95\% CI: 6.83 to 8.52) reported emotional abuse, and 97 (6.58\%; 95\% CI: 5.31 to 7.85) of 1474 respondents with children reported child corporal punishment. We estimated that 3.57\% (95\% CI: -0.33 to 7.46) had non-consensual intercourse with their partner. Our regression analysis revealed an increased risk of physical conflict with home quarantine (odds ratio, OR: 2.38; 95\% CI: 1.56 to 3.61), financial worries (OR: 1.60; 95\% CI: 0.98 to 2.61), poor mental health (OR: 3.41; 95\% CI: 2.12 to 5.50) and young ({$<$}\,10 years) children (OR: 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.32 to 4.64); we obtained similar results for other forms of violence. Awareness and use of pertinent support services was low. Conclusion Our findings of an increased risk of domestic violence during the pandemic should prompt policy-makers to improve the safety of women and children. Interventions to alleviate risks factors and extend support services are required.},

  abstract = {A consistently processed annual global nighttime lights time series (2012--2019) was produced using monthly cloud-free radiance averages made from low light imaging day/night band (DNB) data collected by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The processing steps are modified from the original methods developed to produce annual nighttime lights products from nightly data. Only two years of VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL) were produced with the V.1 methods: 2015 and 2016. Here we report on methods used to produce a V.2 VNL time series from the monthly averages with filtering to remove extraneous features such as biomass burning, aurora, and background. In this case, outlier removal is achieved with a twelve-month median, which discards high and low radiance outliers, thus isolating the background to a narrow range of radiances under 1 nW/cm2/sr. Background areas with no detectable lighting are further isolated using a statistical measure of texture, 3 {\texttimes} 3 data range (DR). The DR threshold for zeroing out background rises as the number of cloud-free observations falls. The V.2 method extends the temporal leverage in the noise filtering by developing the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum DR and a multiyear percent cloud-free grid. Additional noise filtering is achieved by zeroing out grid cells that have low average radiances ({$<$}0.6 nW/cm2/sr) and detection in only one or two years out of eight. The spatial extent and average radiance levels are compared for the V.1 and V.2 2015 VNL. For the vast majority of grid cells, the average radiances are nearly the same in the two products. However, the V.2 product has more areas of dim lighting detected. The key advantages of the V.2 time series include consistent processing and threshold levels across all years, thus optimizing the set for change detection analyses.},

  abstract = {A consistently processed annual global nighttime lights time series (2012--2019) was produced using monthly cloud-free radiance averages made from low light imaging day/night band (DNB) data collected by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The processing steps are modified from the original methods developed to produce annual nighttime lights products from nightly data. Only two years of VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL) were produced with the V.1 methods: 2015 and 2016. Here we report on methods used to produce a V.2 VNL time series from the monthly averages with filtering to remove extraneous features such as biomass burning, aurora, and background. In this case, outlier removal is achieved with a twelve-month median, which discards high and low radiance outliers, thus isolating the background to a narrow range of radiances under 1 nW/cm2/sr. Background areas with no detectable lighting are further isolated using a statistical measure of texture, 3 {\texttimes} 3 data range (DR). The DR threshold for zeroing out background rises as the number of cloud-free observations falls. The V.2 method extends the temporal leverage in the noise filtering by developing the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum DR and a multiyear percent cloud-free grid. Additional noise filtering is achieved by zeroing out grid cells that have low average radiances ({$<$}0.6 nW/cm2/sr) and detection in only one or two years out of eight. The spatial extent and average radiance levels are compared for the V.1 and V.2 2015 VNL. For the vast majority of grid cells, the average radiances are nearly the same in the two products. However, the V.2 product has more areas of dim lighting detected. The key advantages of the V.2 time series include consistent processing and threshold levels across all years, thus optimizing the set for change detection analyses.},

However, human-AI collaboration might introduce automation bias, where users uncritically follow automated cues. This bias may worsen when time pressure strains practitioners' cognitive resources. We quantified automation bias by measuring the adoption of negative system consultations and examined the role of time pressure in a web-based experiment, where trained pathology experts (n=28) estimated tumor cell percentages. Our results indicate that while AI integration led to a statistically significant increase in overall performance, it also resulted in a 7},

  abstract = {From a behavior analysis perspective, this paper identifies the metacontingencies established by the Programa Bolsa Fam{\'i}lia legislation that focus on the fulfillment of education and health requirements by its beneficiaries, called conditionalities. The Programa Bolsa Familia is a conditional cash transfer program, analyzed here as an intervention for an inefficient cultural practice. This cultural practice constitutes interlocked contingencies that hinder school attendance and nutrition of poor and extremely poor children, who turn into adults unprepared for the labor market, perpetuating a cycle of poverty throughout generations. Analysis of the Programa Bolsa Fam{\'i}lia legislation enabled us to find two main types of metacontingencies: 1) one for behavioral change of members of the beneficiary families; and 2) another for managing the education and health conditionalities, from a chain of behaviors emitted by public servants of three government levels--municipal, state, and federal. This analysis described the variables that may have been maintaining the interlocking behavioral contingencies involving the beneficiaries and their behaviors of accessing health and education services, and the interlocking behavioral contingencies involving the public agents that manage the conditionalities. The study concludes that it's important to consider the influence of other variables, regarding health and education services and labor market, to guarantee selection of a new and more efficient cultural practice and to verify if the theoretical model presented in this study is consistent with reality, by conducting field research or studies with secondary data.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Automation bias poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Previous research highlights trust, self-confidence, and task difficulty as key determinants. With the increasing availability of AI-enabled CDSS, automation bias attains new attention. This study therefore aims to identify factors influencing automation bias in a diagnostic task. METHODS A quantitative intervention study with participants from different backgrounds (n = 210) was conducted, employing regression analysis to analyze potential factors. Automation bias was measured as the agreement rate with wrong AI-enabled recommendations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Diagnostic performance, certified wound care training, physician profession, and female gender significantly reduced false agreement rates. Higher perceived benefit of the system was significantly associated with promoting false agreement. Strategies like comprehensive diagnostic training are pivotal in the prevention of automation bias when implementing CDSS. CONCLUSION Considering factors influencing automation bias when introducing a CDSS is critical to fully leverage the benefits of such a system. This study highlights that non-specialists, who stand to gain the most from CDSS, are also the most susceptible to automation bias, emphasizing the need for specialized training to mitigate this risk and ensure diagnostic accuracy and patient safety.},

Say a measure of uncertainty is valid if it corresponds to expected utility loss from not knowing the state in some decision problem. We axiomatically characterize all valid measures of information and uncertainty. We show that if measures of information and uncertainty arise from the same decision problem, then they are coupled in that the expected reduction in uncertainty always equals the expected amount of information generated. We provide explicit formulas for the measure of information that is coupled with any given measure of uncertainty and vice versa. Finally, we show that valid measures of information are the only payment schemes that never provide incentives to delay information revelation. (JEL D81, D83)},

This study constructs a measure of light-based geospatial income inequality (LGII) for 234 countries/territories from 1992 to 2013 using satellite data on night-lights and gridded population data. Key methodological innovations include the use of varying levels of data aggregation, and a calibration of the lights--prosperity relationship to match traditional inequality measures based on income data. The new LGII measure is significantly correlated with cross-country variation in income inequality. Within countries, the light-based inequality measure is also correlated with measures of energy efficiency and the quality of population data. Two applications of the data are provided in the fields of health economics and international finance. The results show that light- and income-based inequality measures lead to similar results, but the geospatial data offer a significant expansion of the number of observations.},

It has been last updated in September 2022 and contains data through 2021 for 108 indicators, capturing various aspects of financial institutions and markets. Please, be advised that the latest release presents changes in the methodology to compute some of the indicators, which have been properly identified in blue in the tab "Metadata".\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The Global Financial Development Database is based on a ``4x2 framework''. Specifically, it includes measures of (1) depth, (2) access, (3) efficiency, and (4) stability of financial systems. Each of these characteristics is captured both for (1) financial institutions (for example banks and insurance companies), and (2) financial markets (such as stock markets and bond markets). The database builds on, updates, and extends previous efforts, in particular the data collected for the World Bank database ``Financial Development and Structure''.\&nbsp;For more information on the Global Financial Development Database, the 4x2 framework, and the underlying theoretical and empirical literature, see chapter 1 of the 2013 Global Financial Development Report, and Martin Cih{\'a}k, Asli Demirg{\"u}{\c c}-Kunt, Erik Feyen, and Ross Levine. 2012. ``Benchmarking Financial Systems around the World.''

During the transition from the traditional agricultural economy to modern economic growth, household real income increases, fertility decreases, and human capital investment per child increases. Motivated by this observation, economists started to develop theoretical models of the child QQ trade-off in the 1970s. Macroeconomic models that theoretically incorporate the QQ trade-off flourish. As a parallel development, empirical studies exploit multiple sources of exogenous variations in family size, such as twin births, child sex composition, and family planning policies, to identify the causal effect of fertility on child quality. Dialogues between theoretical and empirical analyses should empower future research on the child QQ trade-off.},

Using Wisconsin administrative data, this study examined 48 months of subsidy use for mothers who became eligible for child care subsidies between March 2000 and February 2001 (n = 8984). Comparing subsidy-eligible mothers who received subsidies and those who were eligible but did not, we estimated the likelihood of experiencing an increase (or decrease) in earnings and the likelihood of experiencing an increase (or decrease) in the number of quarters employed. We used multinomial regression models to estimate each economic outcome separately and used logistic regression models to estimate both of the outcomes together. In both separate and joint analyses of earnings and quarters employed, we found that subsidy receipt was associated with an increase in the probability of an increase in earnings and/or number of quarters employed and a decrease in the probability of a decrease in quarters employed. However, in general, these associations were only significant when mothers received a subsidy for 12 months or more. These findings suggest the importance of identifying potential barriers to subsidy use, as stable receipt of subsidies may contribute to parents' economic well-being.},

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the impact of the program over more than 10 years after its implementation. A nonexperimental evaluation framework based on multiple pre- and posttreatment periods is used to estimate the policy effects. We find that the reform had important and lasting effects on the number of children aged 1--4 years old attending childcare and the numbers of hours they spend in daycare. For children aged 5 years old, we uncovered strong evidence that implementing full-day kindergarten alone was not enough to increase maternal labour force participation and weeks worked, but when combined with the low-fee daycare program it was, and these effects were also long lasting. Finally, our results on cognitive development suggest the reform did not improve school readiness and may even have had negative impacts on children from low-income families.},

Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.},

However, two waves of behavioral economics demonstrate that the narrowing of people's external environments may change people themselves: poverty lowers the quality of decision-making, and poverty and oppression may depress the capacity to aspire. Poverty and a history of oppression also change how individuals are perceived. To overcome these effects may require helping people acquire new mental models. This essay discusses key findings from behavioral economics, the implications for agency, and some interventions with promising outcomes. We hope to inspire scholars and policymakers to think more deeply about the nature of poverty and oppression and to consider policies that target the psychological and sociological factors that create cycles of poverty.},

Research on automation bias suggests that humans can often be overconfident in AI, whereas research on algorithm aversion shows that, as the stakes of a decision rise, humans become more cautious about trusting algorithms. We theorize about the relationship between background knowledge about AI, trust in AI, and how these interact with other factors to influence the probability of automation bias in the international security context. We test these in a preregistered task identification experiment across a representative sample of 9,000 adults in nine countries with varying levels of AI industries. The results strongly support the theory, especially concerning AI background knowledge. A version of the Dunning--Kruger effect appears to be at play, whereby those with the lowest level of experience with AI are slightly more likely to be algorithm-averse, then automation bias occurs at lower levels of knowledge before leveling off as a respondent's AI background reaches the highest levels. Additional results show effects from the task's difficulty, overall AI trust, and whether a human or AI decision aid is described as highly competent or less competent.},

Expedition research route: Osh --- Kokand --- Tashkent --- Samarkand --- Bukhara. For the regional measurement of population modernization, the following groups of indicators were used: ``characteristics of the cultural landscape'' (for example, the layout of settlements, home and space arrangement, land use, etc.) and ``social portrait of local residents'' (for example, clothing, food preferences, behavior in space, time budget and attitudes of the population). It was revealed that the most conservative and traditional population lives in the regions of the Fergana Valley, the less modernized --- in Osh, Samarkand and Bukhara, the most modernized population --- in Tashkent, Chirchik and Angren. It is found that regional differences in the socio-cultural modernization of the population correlate with the main provisions of the center-peripheral model. Deviations from it are determined by the nature of settlement, the ethnic structure of the population, the involvement of the population in labor migration, the measure of centrality and the absolute height of the settlement above sea level, etc. Thus, the intra-urban division of most cities into mahalla contributes to the preservation of the traditional community in the east and acts as a barrier to the socio-cultural modernization of the population. In the final part of the article, the national features of the socio-cultural modernization of the population of the studied countries are outlined (for example, the high stability of the national socio-cultural tradition, the multidirectional nature of modernization processes), and brief recommendations are given on the use of the research results in managing the socio-economic development of different regions.},

It was revealed that the most conservative and traditional population lives in the regions of the Fergana Valley, the less modernized --- in Osh, Samarkand and Bukhara, the most modernized population --- in Tashkent, Chirchik and Angren. It is found that regional differences in the socio-cultural modernization of the population correlate with the main provisions of the center-peripheral model. Deviations from it are determined by the nature of settlement, the ethnic structure of the population, the involvement of the population in labor migration, the measure of centrality and the absolute height of the settlement above sea level, etc. Thus, the intra-urban division of most cities into mahalla contributes to the preservation of the traditional community in the east and acts as a barrier to the socio-cultural modernization of the population. In the final part of the article, the national features of the socio-cultural modernization of the population of the studied countries are outlined (for example, the high stability of the national socio-cultural tradition, the multidirectional nature of modernization processes), and brief recommendations are given on the use of the research results in managing the socio-economic development of different regions.},

  abstract = {Night-time lights satellite images provide a new opportunity to measure regional inequality in real-time by developing the Night Light Development Index (NLDI). The NLDI was extracted using the Gini coefficient approach based on population and night light spatial distribution in Romania. Night-time light data were calculated using a grid with a 0.15 km2 area, based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) /Operational Linescan System (OLS satellite imagery for the 1992--2013 period and based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership--Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) satellite imagery for the 2014--2018 period. Two population density grids were created at the level of equal cells (0.15 km2) using ArcGIS and PostgreSQL software, and census data from 1992 and 2011. Subsequently, based on this data and using the Gini index approach, the Night Light Development Index (NLDI) was calculated within the MATLAB software. The NLDI was obtained for 42 administrative counties (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics level 3 (NUTS-3 units)) for the 1992--2018 period. The statistical relationship between the NLDI and the socio-economic, demographic, and geographic variables highlighted a strong indirect relationship with local tax income and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The polynomial model proved to be better in estimating income based on the NLDI and R2 coefficients showed a significant improvement in total variation explained compared to the linear regression model. The NLDI calculated on the basis of night-time lights satellite images proved to be a good proxy for measuring regional inequalities. Therefore, it can play a crucial role in monitoring the progress made in the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (reduced inequalities).},

We test this hypothesis in a sample of low-income Indian piece rate manufacturing workers. We stagger when wages are paid out: some workers are paid earlier and receive a cash infusion while others remain liquidity constrained. The cash infusion leads workers to reduce their financial concerns by immediately paying off debts and buying household essentials. Subsequently, they become more productive at work: their output increases by 7.1\% (0.12 SDs), and they make fewer costly, unintentional mistakes. Workers with more cash-on-hand thus not only work faster but also more attentively, suggesting improved cognition. These effects are concentrated among more financially constrained workers. We argue that mechanisms such as gift exchange or nutrition cannot account for our results. Instead, our findings suggest that financial strain, at least partly through psychological channels, has the potential to reduce earnings exactly when money is most needed},

  abstract = {Background. To understand the relationship between parenting and psychopathology in offspring, it is critical to clarify the determinants of parenting behaviour itself. Methods. A 16-item version of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) was administered to parents of epidemiologically sampled adult female--female twin pairs, who reported on the parenting they provided to their twins, and to the twins themselves who reported on the parenting they and their co-twin had received (N l 828 twin families). Using a mixed-model regression, we examined the impact on parenting, as retrospectively reported by parents and twins, of six variable domains : demographic factors, family characteristics, parental symptoms and personality, parental psychopathology, child vulnerability and childhood temperament. Results. The PBI yielded three factors : warmth (W), protectiveness (P) and authoritarianism (A). W was most strongly predicted by parental personality and psychopathology, parental marital quality, and child temperament. P and A were both most strongly predicted by parental educational level and religious fundamentalism. In addition, P was predicted by neurotic{\textbackslash}anxious traits in both parent and child. For a number of variables that predicted W, the strength of the association was stronger when twins were reporting than when parents were reporting. Conclusions. Parenting is a complex, multi-determined set of behaviours that is influenced by parental personality, psychopathology, values and marital quality and by a range of child characteristics. W appears to be strongly influenced by parental and childhood temperament and vulnerability to psychiatric illness while P and A are more strongly influenced by ` sociological ' factors such as religious affiliation and educational status.},

Data are collected on a range of indicators for children, adolescents, women, and in recent years, men. Topics include fertility, mortality, contraceptive use, unmet need, maternal and newborn health, female genital mutilation, menstrual hygiene management, child illness and treatment, and child development and nutrition, among others. The surveys are cross-sectional and use multistage probability designs to develop representative samples of households at the national and subnational levels. Survey interviews are conducted with: a household respondent who provides data on the household status; women and men aged 15--49 who provide current status and retrospective data on themselves; and mothers (or caregivers) who provide data on children under age 18. Data can be compared across countries and time for the most part, provide a wealth of indicators across research fields, and are open access. Data can be accessed on the MICS website where users are granted access to the MICS datasets for research purposes.},

However, AI can also commit errors or suffer from algorithmic bias. Hence, blind trust in technologies carries risks, as users may follow detrimental advice resulting in undesired consequences. Building upon research on algorithm appreciation and trust in AI, the current study investigates whether users who receive AI advice in an uncertain situation overrely on this advice --- to their own detriment and that of other parties. In a domain-independent, incentivized, and interactive behavioral experiment, we find that the mere knowledge of advice being generated by an AI causes people to overrely on it, that is, to follow AI advice even when it contradicts available contextual information as well as their own assessment. Frequently, this overreliance leads not only to inefficient outcomes for the advisee, but also to undesired effects regarding third parties. The results call into question how AI is being used in assisted decision making, emphasizing the importance of AI literacy and effective trust calibration for productive deployment of such systems.},

  abstract = {Although parenting styles constitute a well-known concept in parenting research, two issues have largely been overlooked in existing studies. In particular, the psychological control dimension has rarely been explicitly modelled and there is limited insight into joint parenting styles that simultaneously characterize maternal and paternal practices and their impact on child development. Using data from a sample of 600 Flemish families raising an 8-to-10 year old child, we identified naturally occurring joint parenting styles. A cluster analysis based on two parenting dimensions (parental support and behavioral control) revealed four congruent parenting styles: an authoritative, positive authoritative, authoritarian and uninvolved parenting style. A subsequent cluster analysis comprising three parenting dimensions (parental support, behavioral and psychological control) yielded similar cluster profiles for the congruent (positive) authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles, while the fourth parenting style was relabeled as a congruent intrusive parenting style. ANOVAs demonstrated that having (positive) authoritative parents associated with the most favorable outcomes, while having authoritarian parents coincided with the least favorable outcomes. Although less pronounced than for the authoritarian style, having intrusive parents also associated with poorer child outcomes. Results demonstrated that accounting for parental psychological control did not yield additional parenting styles, but enhanced our understanding of the pattern among the three parenting dimensions within each parenting style and their association with child outcomes. More similarities than dissimilarities in the parenting of both parents emerged, although adding psychological control slightly enlarged the differences between the scores of mothers and fathers.},

We emphasize the need to 1) incorporate and test multiple domains of parent self-regulation to understand their respective and interactive contributions and 2) understand how parent self-regulation interfaces with parent-child coregulation in delineating mechanistic pathways of the effects of harsh discipline on children's adjustment. These foci will more fully inform the etiology of children's maladjustment related to harsh discipline and knowledge regarding specific, malleable intervention targets aimed at reducing harsh discipline.},

  title = {Automation Bias: Exploring Causal Mechanisms and Potential Mitigation Strategies},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Automated decision support tools are designed to aid users and improve their performance in certain tasks by providing advice in the form of prompts, alarms, assessments, or recommendations. However, recent evidence suggests that sometimes use of such tools introduces decision errors that are not made without the tool. We refer to this phenomenon as ``automation bias'' (AB), resulting in a broader definition of this term than used by many authors. Sometimes, such automation-induced errors can even result in overall performance (in terms of correct decisions) which is actually worse with the tool than without it. Our literature review reveals an emphasis on mediators affecting automation bias and some mitigation strategies aimed at reducing it. However, there is a lack of research on the cognitive causal explanations for automation bias and on adaptive mitigation strategies that result in tools that adapt to the needs and characteristics of individual users. This thesis aims to address some of these gaps in the literature and focuses on systems consisting of a human and an automated tool which does not replace, but instead supports the human towards making a decision, with the overall responsibility lying with the human user. The overall goal of this thesis is to help reduce the rate of automation bias through a better understanding of its causes and the proposal of innovative, adaptive mitigation strategies. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive literature review on automation bias including examples, mediators, explanations, and mitigations while identifying areas for further research. This review is followed by the presentation of three experiments aimed at reducing the rate of AB in different ways: (1) an experiment to explore causal mechanisms of automation bias, the effect of the mere presence of tool advice before its presentation and the effect of the sequence of tool advice in a glaucoma risk calculator environment, (2) simulations that apply concepts of diversity to human + human systems to improve system performance in a breast cancer double reading programme, and (3) an experiment to study the possibility of improving system performance by tailoring tool setting (sensitivity / specificity combination) for groups of similarly skilled users and cases of similar difficulty level using a spellchecking tool. Results from the glaucoma experiment provide evidence of the effect of the presence of tool advice on user decisions - even before its presentation, as well as evidence of a newly introduced cognitive mechanism (users' strategic change in decision threshold) which may account for some automation bias errors previously observed but unexplained in the literature. Results from the double reading experiment provide evidence of the benefits of diversity in improving system performance. Finally, results from the spell checker experiment provide evidence that groups of similarly skilled users perform better at different tool settings, that the same group of users perform better using a different tool setting in difficult versus easy tasks, and that use of simple models of user behaviour may allow the prediction, among a subset of tool settings for a certain tool, the tool setting that would be most appropriate for each user ability group and class of case difficulty.},

Participants performed eight trials in a two (Accountable vs. Non-accountable) by two (Feedback vs. No Feedback) by two (automated vs. non-automated) design using the Window/PANES low-fidelity cockpit work simulation. Results indicated that nonautomated condition participants made fewer omission errors and more overall correct responses than those participants in the automated condition. In addition, participants high in perceived accountability made fewer omission errors than those low in perceived accountability while participants who received performance feedback made more correct responses than did those who received no feedback. Results of this study provide evidence that one of the possible causes of automation bias is decreased vigilance engendered by the presence of automated decision aids.},

  doi = {10.4324/9781315095080-17},
  abstract = {Various levels of automation can be introduced by intelligent decision support systems, from fully automated, where the operator is completely left out of the decision process, to minimal levels of automation, where the automation only makes recommendations and the operator has the final say. For rigid tasks that require no flexibility in decision-making and with a low probability of system failure, higher levels of automation often provide the best solution. However, in time critical environments with many external and changing constraints such as air traffic control and military command and control operations, higher levels of automation are not advisable because of the risks and the complexity of both the system and the inability of the automated decision aid to be perfectly reliable. Human-in-the-loop designs, which employ automation for redundant, manual, and monotonous tasks and allow operators active participation, provide not only safety benefits, but also allow a human operator and a system to respond more flexibly to uncertain and unexpected events. However, there can be measurable costs to human performance when automation is used, such as loss of situational awareness, complacency, skill degradation, and automation bias. This paper will discuss the influence of automation bias in intelligent decision support systems, particularly those in aviation domains. Automation bias occurs in decision-making because humans have a tendency to disregard or not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution that is accepted as correct and can be exacerbated in time critical domains. Automated decision aids are designed to reduce human error but actually can cause new errors in the operation of a system if not designed with human cognitive limitations in mind.},

  abstract = {Abstract Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly adopted as decisional aides by public bodies, with the promise of overcoming biases of human decision-makers. At the same time, they may introduce new biases in the human--algorithm interaction. Drawing on psychology and public administration literatures, we investigate two key biases: overreliance on algorithmic advice even in the face of ``warning signals'' from other sources (automation bias), and selective adoption of algorithmic advice when this corresponds to stereotypes (selective adherence). We assess these via three experimental studies conducted in the Netherlands: In study 1 (N = 605), we test automation bias by exploring participants' adherence to an algorithmic prediction compared to an equivalent human-expert prediction. We do not find evidence for automation bias. In study 2 (N = 904), we replicate these findings, and also test selective adherence. We find a stronger propensity for adherence when the advice is aligned with group stereotypes, with no significant differences between algorithmic and human-expert advice. In study 3 (N = 1,345), we replicate our design with a sample of civil servants. This study was conducted shortly after a major scandal involving public authorities' reliance on an algorithm with discriminatory outcomes (the ``childcare benefits scandal''). The scandal is itself illustrative of our theory and patterns diagnosed empirically in our experiment, yet in our study 3, while supporting our prior findings as to automation bias, we do not find patterns of selective adherence. We suggest this is driven by bureaucrats' enhanced awareness of discrimination and algorithmic biases in the aftermath of the scandal. We discuss the implications of our findings for public sector decision making in the age of automation. Overall, our study speaks to potential negative effects of automation of the administrative state for already vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens.},

Poverty assessments for persons with disabilities may be affected by the experience of extra costs associated with a disability. Objective: This article provides a systematized review of the global literature on the direct costs associated with living with a disability at the individual or household level. Methods: We searched three databases for peer-reviewed journal articles that estimated extra costs associated with disability: Econlit, SocIndex and PubMed. Results: We found 20 such studies conducted in 10 countries. These studies were predominantly from high-income countries. Although studies were heterogeneous (e.g., in terms of disability measures and cost methodologies), estimated costs were sizeable and some patterns were consistent across studies. Costs varied according to the severity of disability, life cycle and household composition. Highest costs were observed among persons with moderate and severe disabilities, and among persons with disabilities living alone or in small sized households. Conclusions: More quantitative evidence is needed using rigorous methods, for instance evidence based on longitudinal data and as part of policy evaluations. More internationally comparable data on disability is required for the quantitative evidence to develop, especially in low- and middle-income countries where studies are scarce. Qualitative and participatory research is also needed, especially to investigate unmet needs, and the consequences of extra costs.},

In this article, we estimate the magnitude of these extra costs of living for adults with disabilities aged 50--65 across 15 countries of Europe using the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) data. Drawing on the standard of living approach of Zaidi and Burchardt, we compare the incomes required by households with and without adults with disabilities to obtain an equivalent standard of living. We advance upon this research by drawing on the cross-nationally harmonized data of adults aged 50+ from the SHARE. The results suggest that there are substantial extra costs of disability in these countries: around 44\,percent of income for a household with an adult reporting a workrelated disability and somewhat less than 30 percent of income for a household with an adult who receives disability benefits. Applying an equivalization scale based on these figures increases the overall poverty incidence rate, especially for households with disabled adult members. These findings thus have implications for analysing the entitlement and benefit levels for disability support programmes and for devising accurate poverty estimates concerning persons with disabilities.},

Parental demandingness is associated only with improved child cognition, and parental warmth and rejection are associated only with child behaviour.

  abstract = {Background: Child sexual abuse is considered a modifiable risk factor for mental disorders across the life course. However the long-term consequences of other forms of child maltreatment have not yet been systematically examined. The aim of this study was to summarise the evidence relating to the possible relationship between child physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, and subsequent mental and physical health outcomes. Methods and Findings: A systematic review was conducted using the Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO electronic databases up to 26 June 2012. Published cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that examined non-sexual child maltreatment as a risk factor for loss of health were included. All meta-analyses were based on quality-effects models. Out of 285 articles assessed for eligibility, 124 studies satisfied the pre-determined inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Statistically significant associations were observed between physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect and depressive disorders (physical abuse [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54; 95\% CI 1.16--2.04], emotional abuse [OR = 3.06; 95\% CI 2.43--3.85], and neglect [OR = 2.11; 95\% CI 1.61--2.77]); drug use (physical abuse [OR = 1.92; 95\% CI 1.67--2.20], emotional abuse [OR = 1.41; 95\% CI 1.11--1.79], and neglect [OR = 1.36; 95\% CI 1.21--1.54]); suicide attempts (physical abuse [OR = 3.40; 95\% CI 2.17--5.32], emotional abuse [OR = 3.37; 95\% CI 2.44--4.67], and neglect [OR = 1.95; 95\% CI 1.13--3.37]); and sexually transmitted infections and risky sexual behaviour (physical abuse [OR = 1.78; 95\% CI 1.50--2.10], emotional abuse [OR = 1.75; 95\% CI 1.49--2.04], and neglect [OR = 1.57; 95\% CI 1.39--1.78]). Evidence for causality was assessed using Bradford Hill criteria. While suggestive evidence exists for a relationship between maltreatment and chronic diseases and lifestyle risk factors, more research is required to confirm these relationships. Conclusions: This overview of the evidence suggests a causal relationship between non-sexual child maltreatment and a range of mental disorders, drug use, suicide attempts, sexually transmitted infections, and risky sexual behaviour. All forms of child maltreatment should be considered important risks to health with a sizeable impact on major contributors to the burden of disease in all parts of the world. The awareness of the serious long-term consequences of child maltreatment should encourage better identification of those at risk and the development of effective interventions to protect children from violence.},

  abstract = {Introduction               National data on children affected by violence are critical in preventing violence against children. Rwanda conducted its first cross-sectional national survey on violence against children in 2015. This study used data from the Rwanda Survey to describe the profile of children affected by emotional violence (EV) and to assess factors associated with it in Rwanda.                                         Methods               A sample of 1,110 children (618 boys and 492 girls) aged 13--17 from the Rwanda Survey was analysed. Weighted descriptive statistics were applied to describe the prevalence of EV and the profile of children affected by it. In addition, factors associated with EV were investigated using logistic regression.                                         Results               Male children were more likely to experience EV than female children. Nine percent (8.87\%, 95\% CI [6.95--11.25]) of male children versus five percent (5.17\%, 95\% CI [3.79--7.03]) of female children reported having experienced EV in their lifetime. Seven percent (6.77\%, 95\% CI [5.15--8.84]) of male children versus four percent of female children (3.97\%, 95\% CI [2.83--5.54]) reported having experienced EV in the last twelve months before the survey. Fathers and mothers were the top two perpetrators of EV against children. Seventeen percent of male children (17.09\%, 95\% CI [11.06--25.47]) and 12 percent of female children (11.89\%, 95\% CI [6.97,19.55]) reported EV by their fathers. Mothers were responsible for nineteen percent (19.25\%, 95\% CI [12.94--27.65]) of EV reported by male children and eleven percent (10.78\%, 95\% CI [5.77--19.25]) of EV reported by female children. Female children (OR = 0.48, 95\% CI [0.31--0.76]) and children with some trust in people from their communities (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI [0.23--0.93]) were less likely to report EV. Factors associated with risk for EV were not attending school (OR = 1.80, 95\% CI [1.10--2.92]), living with father only (OR = 2.96, 95\% CI [1.21--7.85]), not feeling close to biological parents (OR = 7.18, 95\% CI [2.12--24.37]), living in a larger household (OR = 1.81, 95\% CI [1.03--3.19]), not having a friend (OR = 2.08, 95\% CI [1.02--4.11]), and not feeling safe in the community (OR = 2.56, 95\% CI [1.03--6.38]).                                         Conclusion               EV against children was pervasive in Rwanda, with parents topping the list of its perpetrators. Children from unsupportive socioeconomic family environments, i.e., children without a close relationship with biological parents, children not attending school, children living with their fathers only, children from larger households of five people and more, children without a friend, and children who reported not feeling safe in their communities, were identified as groups of children vulnerable to emotional violence in Rwanda. A family-centred approach, focusing on positive parenting and protecting vulnerable children, is needed to reduce emotional violence against children and the risk factors associated with it in Rwanda.},

To answer this, we design a workshop teaching techniques to raise aspirations and encourage long-term planning. We cross-randomise this with large unconditional cash transfers in a 415-village, 8,300-person, 1.5-year experiment in Kenya. The workshop increases aspirations and investment, and raises living standards, at least twice as cost-effectively as cash transfers. But combining the workshop with cash produces similar effects to cash alone, potentially because cash raises aspirations. This shows that alleviating psychological constraints can improve economic outcomes but these constraints may relax when material conditions improve.},

In this paper we estimate the direct cost associated with disability for households in Cambodia. Using the Standard of Living approach, the direct cost associated with having a member with disabilities is estimated to be 19 per cent of monthly household consumption expenditure. Accounting for the direct cost of disability doubles the poverty rate amongst households with disabled members from 18 per cent to 37 per cent, and increases the poverty gap from 3 to 8 per cent. A comparison of the direct cost associated with disability and income support received from government and family sources reveals that only 7 per cent of the costs of disability are met. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of increased coverage of public income support, households with disabled members will continue to experience a lower standard of living compared to households without disability in Cambodia.},

Using nationally representative survey data from Samoa, which has among the world's highest fertility rates, I extend the classic work on child quantity--quality trade-offs to also consider domestic violence. Identification is based on instrumental variable (IV) strategies exploiting three distinct and plausibly exogenous drivers of additional fertility: (1) same-sex sibling pairs in families with two or more children; (2) multiple births (twin); and (3) a female firstborn. I find evidence of a direct causal link between family size and an increased prevalence of intimate partner violence by, on average, 5 percentage points, equivalent to a 13\% increase from the mean. This significant effect is largely driven by physical or sexual abuse often associated with serious victim injuries. The IV estimates also suggest that larger families tend to have attitudes that condone violent behavior. The normalization of violent behavior in larger families may be linked to a lack of resources available to effectively address and resolve conflicts, ultimately contributing to an increased likelihood of violent incidents. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness of the potential victimization risks for larger families and the importance of integrated family planning and domestic violence prevention efforts.},

Results: Automation complacency occurs under conditions of multiple-task load, when manual tasks compete with the automated task for the operator's attention. Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency. Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics. Application: The integrated model and attentional synthesis provides a heuristic framework for further research on complacency and automation bias and design options for mitigating such effects in automated and decision support systems.},

  abstract = {There is substantial evidence that women tend to support different policies and political candidates than men. Many studies also document gender differences in a variety of important preference dimensions, such as risk-taking, competition and pro-sociality. However, the degree to which differential voting by men and women is related to these gaps in more basic preferences requires an improved understanding. We conduct an experiment in which individuals in small laboratory ``societies'' repeatedly vote for redistribution policies and engage in production. We find that women vote for more egalitarian redistribution and that this difference persists with experience and in environments with varying degrees of risk. This gender voting gap is accounted for partly by both gender gaps in preferences and by expectations regarding economic circumstances. However, including both these controls in a regression analysis indicates that the latter is the primary driving force. We also observe policy differences between male- and female-controlled groups, though these are substantially smaller than the mean individual differences---a natural consequence of the aggregation of individual preferences into collective outcomes.},

  abstract = {Why do parents parent the way they do?'' remains an important question since it concerns both scientific issues, such as the stability or change of childrearing behavior, and clinical issues, such as the way to promote positive parenting in evidence-based programs. Using an accelerated design, the aim of this study was to examine several parental and child predictors of childrearing behavior trajectories among 373 mothers and 356 fathers of 2- to 9-year-old children. Hypotheses were drawn from Belsky (1984) and subsequent studies of the determinants of parenting. The parental and child predictors were assessed and analyzed as time-varying (parental self-efficacy beliefs and child externalizing behavior) or time-invariant (parental educational level and personality traits) predictors, according to their conceptual properties. The results show a linear decrease in both supportive and controlling childrearing behavior in mothers and an improvement in supportive but a decrease in controlling childrearing behavior in fathers over time. Moreover, the results support the idea that childrearing behavior is determined by multiple factors, in particular the parents' self-efficacy beliefs and the child's behavior. Finally, the results confirm the hypothesis of a greater influence of child predictors than of parental ones in the case of mothers, while the reverse hypothesis of a greater predictive power of parental variables than of child ones is confirmed for fathers. The results are discussed both for research and clinical purposes.},

This review described the characteristics of structural, community, interpersonal, individual, and multilevel GBV interventions in LMIC and examined components of interventions implemented at different socio-ecological levels. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature on GBV intervention evaluation studies in LMIC using the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, Academic Search Ultimate, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The search resulted in 3,256 articles, with 60 articles meeting the eligibility criteria. Thirty-eight articles reported positive GBV outcomes with significant differences between intervention and control arms on at least one GBV outcome. Very few interventions were found to be stand-alone GBV interventions. The key components of interventions effective in addressing victimization and perpetration across levels were education or psychoeducation, psychotherapy, skills development, gender transformative activities, community engagement, focus on men and/or partners, and health promotion activities such as HIV or STI prevention. Most interventions were multilevel, with positive outcomes for victimization. Fewer evidence-based interventions existed for addressing perpetration. There is need for additional research using rigorous methods to establish an evidence base for effective interventions in under-researched regions in LMIC as well as for interventions that address perpetration of GBV.},

Some explanations for these behaviors focus on personality traits of the poor. Others emphasize environmental factors such as housing or financial access. We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention: It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments, we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. We discuss how this mechanism might also explain other puzzles of poverty.},

  abstract = {Childhood is a critical period in the development of obesity. Eating patterns established early in life track into later life. Therefore, parental approaches to feeding in their general parenting style, feeding styles, and specific feeding practices will have a profound impact on how children eat and grow. A systematic research review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted to identify, discuss and integrate recent research investigating the relationship between parenting styles, feeding styles, feeding practices, and body mass index (BMI) in children. Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts were systematically searched using sensitive search strategies. Studies were limited to papers published in English between 2010 and February 2015 with participants aged 4--12 years old with outcomes including obesity, change in weight, or BMI. The search yielded 31 relevant quantitative peer-reviewed papers meeting all inclusion criteria: seven longitudinal, 23 cross-sectional, one randomized control trial. Associations between parenting style and child BMI were strongest and most consistent within the longitudinal studies. Uninvolved, indulgent or highly protective parenting was associated with higher child BMI, whereas authoritative parenting was associated with a healthy BMI. Similarly for feeding styles, indulgent feeding was consistently associated with risk of obesity within cross-sectional studies. Specific feeding practices such as restriction and pressure to eat were linked to BMI, especially within cross-sectional studies. Where child traits were measured, the feeding practice appeared to be responsive to the child, therefore restriction was applied to children with a high BMI and pressure to eat applied to children with a lower BMI. Behaviors and styles that are specific to the feeding context are consistently associated with child BMI. However, since obesity emerges over time, it is through longitudinal, carefully measured (through questionnaire and observation) studies which take account of child appetite and temperament that the association between parenting style, feeding style, specific feeding practices, and child obesity will be understood.},

However, reviews that evaluate the relationship between parenting style and weight-related outcomes have not focused on prospective studies. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo for studies published between 1995 and 2016 that evaluated the prospective relationship between parenting style experienced in childhood and subsequent weight outcomes. Results: We identified 11 prospective cohort studies. Among the eight studies that categorized parenting style into distinct groups (i.e. authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful), five provided evidence that authoritative parenting was associated with lower body mass index gains. Among the six highest quality studies, four suggested a protective role of authoritative parenting style against adverse weight-related outcomes. However, only one study controlled for a comprehensive set of confounders, and the small number of studies conducted within certain age groups precluded our ability to ascertain critical periods when parenting style is most strongly related to child weight. Conclusions: The present literature supports the idea that authoritative parenting may be protective against later overweight and obesity, although findings are mixed. More prospective cohort studies of longer durations, with more sophisticated methods that examine age-varying relationships, and that control for a comprehensive set of confounders, are needed.},

  abstract = {Formal savings are a promising tool to reduce poverty, but savings rates of the poor are usually puzzlingly low. One potentially important but so far neglected explanation is the endowment effect. The relative reluctance of individuals to give up things they have been endowed with has been shown to cause market inefficiencies and can have important implications for the design of contracts and institutions. In many developing countries, poor households receive their income in cash. Being 'endowed' with cash that needs to be physically deposited into a savings account might increase the psychological costs of saving. I experimentally study the causal effect of cash endowments on savings deposits of microfinance clients, using a simple, high-stakes natural decision with external validity and controlling for potential confounds such as transaction costs and time preferences. Cash endowments make individuals feel richer, yet this feeling of endowment does not translate into lower savings. Cash in this setting appears to be fully fungible.},

Prevalence is further escalated in low-and-middle-income countries and in humanitarian crises. Survivors are left with a combination of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. These mental health disorders lead to further morbidity and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and co-morbidities, gender disparities and mental health stigma globally lead to few interventions developed for this population. The aim of this review is to highlight the mental health interventions developed in the past 5 years, for women following GBV in low-and-middle-income countries. It aims to discuss their efficacy and controversies when implemented into healthcare systems, understand the gaps that remain in the field and suggest future research developments. A thorough literature search revealed 16 new interventions available for improving mental health outcomes for women following GBV in low-and-middle-income countries. Following an in-depth evaluation of the papers, one intervention was successful in effectively implementing treatment into healthcare systems---``PM+.'' However, it proved only to be effective in the short term. Further research must be done for improving long-term mental health outcomes. Results demonstrated poor follow-up for women engaging in group therapy. The review also highlights community workers were used in service delivery to reduce barriers accessing care. No interventions proved effective in humanitarian crises, despite GBV escalated in these settings. There are very few interventions available in comparison to the prevalence of this global health issue. Therefore, this review encourages further research and improvements in mental healthcare interventions following GBV.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In diverse societies, addressing such group disparities is imperative to promote economic efficiency, political stability, and social cohesion. This thematic issue investigates the level of public support for HI-correcting policies across nine contexts: Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Malaysia, Kenya, Western Balkans, India, the United States, and Northern Ireland. The articles within this issue collectively identify and analyze crucial factors at the individual, group, and national levels. In this editorial, we summarize major findings, reflecting on the salience of group identity across majority and minority contexts, the role of perceptions vs more objective measures of inequality and its causes, and the significance of shifting political climates and societal discourses.},

Combining novel survey data from Angolan war veteran families and a natural experiment, we find that exposure to sexual violence by armed groups against women makes male veterans about 30 percentage points more likely to commit physical -- but not sexual -- violence against a female intimate partner 18 years later (on average). Our results are not consistent with standard explanations of IPV based on group norms and intra-household bargaining. Instead, we attribute the effect to a lasting reduction in self-control skills. These findings challenge standard approaches to preventing IPV and emphasize the potential of working with men, especially after war-time episodes of collective violence.},

Method: Description of the conceptual and methodological approaches used and psychometric data for a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. children. Results: (1) Improved Psychological Aggression and Physical Assault scales. (2) New Nonviolent Discipline scale, supplementary scale for Neglect, and supplemental questions on discipline methods and sexual abuse. (3) Reliability ranges from low to moderate. (4) Evidence of discriminant and construct validity. Conclusions: The CTSPC is better suited to measuring child maltreatment than the original CTS. It is brief (6 to 8 minutes for the core scales) and therefore practical for epidemiological research on child maltreatment and for clinical screening. Methodological issues inherent in parent self-report measures of child maltreatment are discussed. {\copyright} 1998 M. A. Straus. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd},

The study explored the importance of wife abuse relative to blocks of parent, child, and family characteristics and also relative to specific risk factors. Method: This study re-analyzed a sub-sample (N ϭ 2,733) of data from the 1985 National Family Violence Survey. Hierarchical logistic regressions were conducted, using five different criterion variables measuring physical child abuse, physical punishment, and verbal abuse separately and in combination. Results: Blocks of parent, child, and family characteristics were more important predictors of violence towards children than was wife abuse, though the presence of wife abuse in the home was a consistently significant specific risk factor for all forms of violence against children. Of specific risk factors, a respondent's history of having been hit as an adolescent was a larger risk factor for physical child abuse than was wife abuse. Wife abuse was an important predictor of physical punishment. Non-violent marital discord was a greater factor in predicting likelihood of verbal child abuse than was wife abuse. Conclusions: Though this study confirms the association between wife abuse and violence towards children, it cautions us not to overlook the contribution of other factors in our attempts to understand the increased risk attributed to wife abuse. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe harmful effects of Covid 19 on children living in poverty have refocused attention on the complex nature of child poverty and the vexed question of its relationship to education. The paper examines a tension at the heart of much discussion of child poverty and education. On the one hand, education is often regarded as essential for children's flourishing and a means by which children can ``escape'' poverty; yet on the other hand, education systems, institutions, and practices, often reflect and entrench the disadvantages associated with poverty. Narratives concerning education as an escape from poverty tend not to deal in any depth with the injustices associated with poverty, stressing instead the transformative potential of education. By contrast, largely sociological analyses of the ways in which schooling reproduces inequalities tend to stop short of developing a normative account of how education can contribute to transforming the structural injustices related to poverty and its effects on children's lives. In working to move beyond this analytic impasse, the paper shows how the cluster of concepts, which Robeyns (2018) locates as central to the capability approach, give insights which help to address these two different lacunae. The notion of conversion factors highlights the significance of taking account of existing relationships in education, while the distinction between capabilities and functionings helps guide practices regarding the education of children living in poverty. Drawing on literature on the heightened inequalities associated with poor children's experience of lack of schooling during the COVID pandemic, the paper sketches some of the ways in which sociological analysis and normative evaluation can be linked in taking forward an ``ethically engaged political philosophy'' (Wolff, 2018) to discuss child poverty and education in real schools.},

Making use of research on this topic over the past decade, this paper summarizes the current state of our knowledge about how people engage in mental accounting activities. Three components of mental accounting receive the most attention. This {\textregistered}rst captures how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and subsequently evaluated. The accounting system provides the inputs to be both ex ante and ex post cost{\textpm}bene{\textregistered}t analyses. A second component of mental accounting involves the assignment of activities to speci{\textregistered}c accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds are labeled in real as well as in mental accounting systems. Expenditures are grouped into categories (housing, food, etc.) and spending is sometimes constrained by implicit or explicit budgets. The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which accounts are evaluated and `choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily, weekly, yearly, and so on, and can be de{\textregistered}ned narrowly or broadly. Each of the components of mental accounting violates the economic principle of fungibility. As a result, mental accounting in{\textasciimacron}uences choice, that is, it matters.

Purpose To determine how automation bias can affect inexperienced, moderately experienced, and very experienced radiologists when reading mammograms with the aid of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods In this prospective experiment, 27 radiologists read 50 mammograms and provided their Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment assisted by a purported AI system. Mammograms were obtained between January 2017 and December 2019 and were presented in two randomized sets. The first was a training set of 10 mammograms, with the correct BI-RADS category suggested by the AI system. The second was a set of 40 mammograms in which an incorrect BI-RADS category was suggested for 12 mammograms. Reader performance, degree of bias in BI-RADS scoring, perceived accuracy of the AI system, and reader confidence in their own BI-RADS ratings were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by the Dunn post hoc test.

  abstract = {Central Asian countries represent an important context for understanding intersections between Islam, patriarchy, and women's well-being. In recent decades, challenges and opportunities resulting from transitions to a market economy exacerbated gender imbalances in labor markets and opportunity structures of the region. Women of the region are highly educated and make significant economic contributions to support their families through employment. However, their views about gender roles remain unclear, and it is also uncertain whether opportunity structures and social mobility have influenced these views. The current study addresses these gaps using probability-based survey data (N = 3,405) from four Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Latent class analysis reveals three latent profiles of women's views on gender roles: traditional views, egalitarian views, and dual views. Religious identity, education, opportunity structure, and social mobility intersect with women's ideas about gender roles.}

Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human--AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human--AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges'               g               \,=\,-0.23; 95\% confidence interval, -0.39 to -0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human--AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human--AI systems.},

These factors can differently contribute to parenting style. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to examine psychological factors affecting parenting style. Methods: This study was a comprehensive literature review using the keywords of parenting styles, psychological factors, and parenting to search the databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Scientific Information Database. In this respect, 416 articles were extracted. 368 articles were removed after reviewing their abstracts and full text and eventually 48 articles were selected to elicit the required data. Results: Our findings were classified under two categories: factors related to parents (mental health status, self-efficacy, parenting stress, perfectionism, personality traits, childhood trauma, marital satisfaction, parents' attachment style, perceived parenting style, and substance abuse); and those related to children (child developmental and mental disability, child temperament, and anxiety). Conclusions: Considering the multiple psychological factors that affect parenting style, it is recommended to include an assessment of parent-child psychological status in family health programs in order to identify the needs for health-oriented care and take steps towards the development of parenting skills.},

We first outline psychological and neuroscientific theories of cognitive effort. Then we describe the benefits of a neuroeconomic research strategy, highlighting how it affords greater inferential traction than do traditional markers of cognitive effort, including self-reports and physiologic markers of autonomic arousal. Finally, we sketch a future series of studies that can leverage the full potential of the neuroeconomic approach toward understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to phenomenal, subjective cognitive effort.},

Using the third round of the Life in Transition Survey (fielded in 2016, including 29 countries transitioning from communism) and outcome variables that tap into general attitudes about closing the income gap between the rich and the poor and willingness to pay more to help the needy, we examine how individual attitudes toward government, as well as the rich and the poor are associated with support for redistribution (final analyzed sample n {$>$} 23,700). Using logit multivariate regression analysis, we find that trust in government institutions and perceptions of public corruption are associated with certain redistributive attitudes, while individual attitudes toward the rich and the poor are consistently associated with both the general beliefs that income gaps in the country should be reduced and individual levels of willingness to pay more to help the needy.},

A national probability sample of 6,002 households was surveyed by telephone in 1985, of which 3,232 households had at least one child under 18 years old living at home. Minor violence, or physical punishment, was most common among mothers, caretakers 18 to 37 years old, fathers who were unemployed, caretakers with blue-collar occupations, households with two to four children at home, and among caretakers who used alcohol and other drugs, male children, and children 3 to 6 years old. The highest rates ofabusive violence occurred in families located in the East, families whose annual income was below the poverty line, families where the father was unemployed, families where the caretakers held blue-collar jobs, families with four or more children, caretakers who used drugs at least once, male children, and children 3 to 6 years old. Logistic regressions were done to examine the predictive value of these variables.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Summary               The article deals with the ethical and legal aspects of the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. The author analyses key threats to the fundamental values held by the majority of democratic society and the human rights guaranteed by international human rights treaties, such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Emphasis is placed, in particular, on the risk of restricting patients' autonomy due to an insufficient regulation of the use of clinical decision-support systems, a lack of humanistic care due to excessive use of care robots, a decline in human skills in specific fields of medicine, such as radiology, and the violation of privacy by extensive surveillance of social media. The article provides an overview of the benefits of artificial intelligence for healthcare, but also warns of the downsides, with the aim to encourage a debate that would lead to reasonable legal regulation.},
